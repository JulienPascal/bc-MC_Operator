# README

Files executed on Google Colab. Notebooks and output files (initially saved on Google Drive) were then downloaded locally.
Notebooks are for different optimizers (ADAM or SGD) and different values of the learning rate.

To create plots (saved in the folder output), use the notebook plot_BM.ipynb. Functions are stored in the notebook functions_BM.ipynb.

Images were created in color by the notebook plot_BM.ipynb. To convert images in grayscale, use the bash script convert_to_grayscale.sh, which relies on Ghostscript: https://www.ghostscript.com/
